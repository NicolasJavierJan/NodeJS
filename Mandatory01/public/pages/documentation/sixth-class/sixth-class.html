      <h5>Client Side Redirection vs Server Side Redirection:</h5>
      <p>Client side redirect is a direct forward to a destination url. The redirect is induced by the client (browswer) directly:</p>
      <div class="code">
        <p>location.href = "url"</p>
        <p>location.replace("url")</p>
        <p>etc...</p>
      </div>
      <p>Server Side Redirect happens when an HTTP request to a web server is answered with a server status code, which indicates that the requested document has moved to another URL. The client will then request the destination URL and the user gets forwarded.</p>
      <h5>Client Side Fetch vs Fetch in the FrontEnd</h5>

      <h5>Semantic HTML</h5>
      <p>Semantic Elements clearly describe the meaning to both browser and developer: figure, footer, header, main, section, summary, form, etc.</p>
